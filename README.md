#rabbitpy

Another place for rabbits to play


#Description

Rabbits share a lot of diseases, bugs and worms. That's because they're
similar to rodents or something. I don't know what they are actually. Pythons
probably eat rabbits, but there aren't any here so they spread everywhere and
eat all the corn. In short, we need more Python so let's put it here.
